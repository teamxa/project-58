            my hobby is cooking and i like to cook food because it is so intresting and i like to make tasty food .ido cooking at weekends
Cooking is something I find enjoyable and it is an easy thing you can do with friends. When cooking with friends I like to have everyone do a little bit of everything because it makes things more enjoyable. I enjoy trying new recipes when cooking for friends and family to get a wider range of opinion.
